__Important__

Army composition works properly only when you set a "Cost Limits" when creating a rooster!


__I found a bug / I'd do something differently__

* Drop me an email - you can find the address in the ReadMe file when you create a new army
* [Open Issue directly][] (```New Issue```) - you need a GitHub account and then can track progress (get notifications on it!), comment (i.e. answer our questions) and help us better!


* __I'd just like to contact you.__

  Then join us on Argatoria Discord and drop us a line on #battlescribe channel
