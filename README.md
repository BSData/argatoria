## Important ##

Army composition rules work properly ONLY when you set a "Cost Limits" when creating a rooster!

## I found a bug / I'd do something differently ##

* Drop me an email - you can find the address in the ReadMe file when you create a new army
* [Open Issue directly][] (```New Issue```) - you need a GitHub account and then can track progress (get notifications on it!), comment (i.e. answer our questions) and help us better!

## I'd just like to contact you ##

Try Argatoria Discord and drop us a line on #battlescribe channel, you'll probabily not get an answer regarding these files on BattleScribe Discord
